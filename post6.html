                        <p>
                            The aviation industry is one of the fastest growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions, and it is critical to reducing emissions and mitigating the impact of climate change. To address this challenge, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized agency of the United Nations, established the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia), a global carbon offsetting scheme for the aviation industry.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The development of Corsia was driven by the recognition that the aviation industry has a significant impact on the environment, and that it is critical to finding solutions to reduce emissions and mitigate the impact of climate change. Corsia was established as a way to stabilize the growth of international aviation emissions at 2020 levels, and to achieve a carbon-neutral growth in international aviation from 2020 onwards.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Corsia will be used by airlines operating international flights, and it will require them to offset their emissions through the purchase of carbon credits from approved offset projects. These carbon credits represent emissions reductions that have been achieved through renewable energy, energy efficiency, and other projects that reduce emissions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The impact of Corsia is significant, as it will help to reduce emissions from the aviation industry and to drive the transition to a low-carbon future. By requiring airlines to offset their emissions, Corsia will create a market for carbon credits, providing incentives for businesses and organizations to invest in emissions reduction projects and to transition to a low-carbon economy. In addition, Corsia will help to reduce emissions from the aviation industry, which is one of the fastest growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions, and it will play a critical role in the fight against climate change.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, it is important to note that Corsia is not a comprehensive solution to the challenge of climate change, and it is only one part of a broader effort to reduce emissions and to transition to a low-carbon future. To achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and to limit the rise in global temperature, it will require a concerted effort by all sectors of the economy, including the aviation industry, to reduce emissions and to transition to a low-carbon future.
                        </p>
                        <div class="article__subtitle subtitle">
                            What Comes Next in the Fight Against Climate Change?
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            The establishment of Corsia is a significant step forward in the fight against climate change, but it is only one part of a broader effort to reduce emissions and to transition to a low-carbon future. To achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and to limit the rise in global temperature, it will require continued innovation, investment, and cooperation by all sectors of the economy, including the aviation industry.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the years to come, we can expect to see continued efforts to reduce emissions and to transition to a low-carbon future. This will include the development of new technologies, the expansion of renewable energy, and the implementation of policies and programs to reduce emissions and to transition to a low-carbon economy. Additionally, we can expect to see increased cooperation and collaboration between countries, businesses, and organizations, as we work together to find solutions to the challenge of climate change.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In conclusion, Corsia is a significant step forward in the fight against climate change, and it will play a critical role in reducing emissions from the aviation industry and in driving the transition to a low-carbon future. However, it is only one part of a broader effort to reduce emissions and to transition to a low-carbon future, and it will require continued innovation, investment, and cooperation by all sectors of the economy to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and to limit the rise in global temperature.
